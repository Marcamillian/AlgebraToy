1. make sure that the getState doesn't return values that can affect the original - get a shallow copy of the getState

2. how to compare two objects - e.g. testing cant compare {x: 2, y:2} and {x:2, y:2}

Event Flow

- user clicks the element that it wants
- clicked element becomes active
  - element highlights in some way
  - other clickable elements highlight
- another element clicked
  = IF 
    == Element is valid
      - each element operates on eachother (does one always disappear?)
    == Element is not valid
      - the current highlights clear
      - new element become the only active element
    == Click is not on a element
      - the current highlights clear


? how do we determine what is operatable
  - a factor of a bracket
  - inside the same bracket/statement
  - brackets
    - are these a special type of wrapper?
      - if the wrapper gets divided or multiplied - it becomes the factor of the bracket
      - if the wrapper gets added|minused - it appends to the inside of the statement
