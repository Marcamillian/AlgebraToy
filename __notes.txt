TODO : 1. make sure that the getState doesn't return values that can affect the original - get a shallow copy of the getState

TODO: 2. how to compare two objects - e.g. testing cant compare {x: 2, y:2} and {x:2, y:2}

Event Flow

- user clicks the element that it wants
- clicked element becomes active
  - element highlights in some way
  - other clickable elements highlight
- another element clicked
  = IF 
    == Element is valid
      - each element operates on eachother (does one always disappear?)
    == Element is not valid
      - the current highlights clear
      - new element become the only active element
    == Click is not on a element
      - the current highlights clear


[x] how do we determine what is operatable
  - a factor of a bracket
  - inside the same bracket/statement
  - brackets
    - are these a special type of wrapper?
      - if the wrapper gets divided or multiplied - it becomes the factor of the bracket
      - if the wrapper gets added|minused - it appends to the inside of the statement
      

[x] in the same bracket they will add
[x] outside the bracket will multiply it by the factor


THINGS TO DO WITH STATEMENTS - 

- Multiplying the whole THING
- Muliplying inside terms by the multiply factor
- can a statement be the multiplying factor? -- not in the current build
[x] Game controller is the only one that knows what is clicked
   - it needs to ask if it is a member of a statement

[x]APPROACHES - term has a "parent" that you can check --- test this out

Click inside the bracket - hightlight the factor & all other terms in that statement
  - click on something highlighted - try to do the calculation
  - click on something outside - move the hightlight - 

  === QUESTION - how do we know if the term is a part of the statement / factor

=== 

TODO: How to deal with clicked STATEMENTS
 - two statements to compare - which to replace 
   - the one inside the statement (multiply)
   - either one inside the statement



TODO: multiply out - make a new term in the parent statement -- if there is no term left in the statement the statement disappears
 -- 2018/05/05 I think this is what I'm seeing - multiplying out the LHS on the first equation - end up with a statement that has a factor but no terms
 --- this is now resolved - am now checking that if the
